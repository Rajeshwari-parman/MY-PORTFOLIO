# MY-PORTFOLIO

ðŸ§¾ Personal Portfolio Website

As part of my internship at CodTech, I developed a static personal portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This responsive and professionally designed site serves as a digital resume, showcasing my skills, projects, educational background, and contact details. The primary goal was to create a user-friendly interface that highlights my strengths as a developer while offering a clean, interactive browsing experience for potential employers and clients.

ðŸ“Œ Description

The website is built as a single-page layout with smooth scroll navigation, segmented into essential sections such as landing, about, skills, portfolio, and contact. It emphasizes clarity, responsiveness, and interactivity, ensuring that the site works seamlessly across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. Through the use of semantic HTML, flexible CSS layouts, and JavaScript-based enhancements, the site delivers a modern user experience while remaining lightweight and fast-loading.

ðŸ”§ Tools & Technologies Used

HTML (HyperText Markup Language)

Structured all content using semantic elements (e.g., <header>, <section>, <footer>) for better readability and accessibility.

Defined key sections like landing, about me, skills, projects, and contact.

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

Utilized Flexbox and Grid to create responsive, adaptive layouts.

Applied consistent styling using a custom color palette, animations, transitions, and media queries.

Ensured visual consistency and responsiveness across devices.

JavaScript

Added client-side form validation for the contact section.

Enabled smooth scroll navigation, scroll-based animations, and dark/light theme toggling.

Enhanced interactivity without relying on backend services.

âœ¨ Key Features

Landing Section: Features name, role, and a call-to-action (resume download).

About Me: Includes a short biography and profile image.

Skills Display: Showcases core technical competencies across languages, frameworks, and tools.

Project Portfolio: Each project includes a title, description, tech stack, and GitHub link.

Contact Form: Functional form with JS validation for name and email inputs.

Responsive Navigation: Sticky menu with smooth scrolling to each section.

ðŸŽ¨ Design Philosophy

Built with a modern, minimalistic design in mind, the site prioritizes readability, accessibility, and user engagement. A consistent visual hierarchy, clean typography, and balanced white space guide the viewer naturally through the content. Responsive design was central, with media queries and adaptive layouts ensuring usability across devices. Interactive features were intentionally lightweight to preserve performance and enhance usability.
